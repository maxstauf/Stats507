### PS2Q3

[Link](/PS2Q3)

This file solely contains the third question of problem set 2.
This question focuses on reading, cleaning, and joining several data files from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Taking several of the cohort years, the datasets are read in and filtered, then finally joined once together to create two datasets spanning every year for the demographic variables as well as the 
corresponding dentition data. 
Creating these data frames are the beginings of performing analyses on the full NHANES data. By getting a finalized data frame for each, we can begin exploring methods and observational
techniques that allow us to see and interpret the results from the survey data. The variables selected and adjusted in this problemset are ones that are interesting to model and explore with.
